## Microsoft does not deserve your patronage.

- Microsoft, its partners, its employees, its leadership, and its subsidiaries are all complicit (if not eagerly helpful and instrumental) in the shameless genocide of Palestinians, and the fascist persecution of anyone who dares defy or condemn such cruelty. It has directly provided cloud infrastructure and AI services to the Israeli Defense Force, and has cooperated with the FBI to identify individuals who have protested the current occupation of Palestine and the imminent extermination of all of its inhabitants.
- Microsoft willingly and knowingly associates and partners with Palantir, a digital data broker that is known to cooperate with the Trump administration as part of its campaign of terror and persecution against immigrants, or anyone else deemed an enemy of the State.
- Microsoft willingly cooperates with Twitter and its AI division, "xAI". Twitter is owned by the notorious Nazi  Elon Musk, and his AI "Grok" has engaged in claims of "white genocide", Holocaust denial, and on multiple occasions, referred to itself as "Mecha-Hitler", all at the behest of Musk.
